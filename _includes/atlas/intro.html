  This bootcamp is organized as a part of the <a href="https://po.usatlas.bnl.gov/">US-ATLAS</a> support center to help you be more productive researchers.
  It is run with the additional help of <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> (Elizabeth Wickes) and <a href="https://iris-hep.org/">IRIS-HEP</a>/Princeton (Henry Schreiner).
  Both of these organizations aim to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills.

  <br>
  <br>

  This is a hands-on bootcamp that will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including version control, building code with CMake, testing your code with
  continuous integration, and packaging/distributing your code with containers.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they
  have learned to their own research problems.
