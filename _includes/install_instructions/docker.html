Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

  <h3>Docker</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a powerful tool that allows you
    to perform a virtualization of your environment but completely in software.  It
    allows you to bundle up the installation of tools for use by others in a uniform way
    and we will be using it throughout this bootcamp.  Installing docker is absolutely
    necessary and there are directions to do this in each operating system.  For those
    of you that are using a Windows operating system, if you already have docker running
    and are comfortable using it, that is fine.  However, if you do not, then be aware
    that its usage on Windows can be challenging and none of the tutors know how to use
    such a setup.  Therefore, <strong>we highly reccomend that you reconsider
    your decision to use the Windows operating system as a high energy physicist.</strong>

          <li>Docker is a full development platform for creating containerized apps, and Docker Desktop for Mac is the best way to get started with Docker on a Mac.

          <li>Please read the relevant information on these pages, it should take no more than 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Another common way to install packages on Mac OSX is via the <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> package manager.  In the case of docker, you can easily install
          docker by setting up homebrew and executing <code>brew cask install docker</code>.</li>
